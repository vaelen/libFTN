So you're after Areafix help eh? 
You found the right automated netmail reply then :) Here's some help about
how you can use AreaFix to change your echomail areas. Remember all AreaFix
commands are case insensitive, you can use %help as well as %HELP.
Tips:
1) Make sure you send netmail to a HUB using a netmail base on your BBS
   If you fail to do this chances are you are posting your password in
   the subject line to everyone to read in an echomail base. 
2) Your HUB may have set your replies to HOLD so wait a couple of mins
   then try polling your HUB again to collect the Areafix netmail reply
   from the HUB if it has not pushed it (CRASH) to your BBS already.
3) This HUB is powered by HPT so the syntax to get a rescan of messages
   is different from Mystic BBS powered HUBs. Here's a quick example
   of what you can do to rescan older messages from echomail areas you are
   linked to. 
   Let's assume you have access to fsxNet (Zone 21) echomail areas and you
   want to get the last 100 days from all echos. In this example we are 
   assume you have an fsxNet address of 21:1/999 and your HUB password
   is PASSWORD.

  Notes:
  Any other lines will be ignored
  <area>     - an areaname, for example FIDOSOFT.HUSKY
  <areamask> - areamask may contain '*' and '?' wild card characters,
               '*' may substitute any string and '?' substitutes one character;
               for example, ru.*
  N          - some number
  [password] - optional password without brackets. If no password is
               specified, an empty password will be used
  You may also specify 1/0 as the aliases for on/off.
  Example: "%RSB 1" acts the same as "%RSB on".
  Some commands may/may not work for you depending on what the admin has
  set up for you.
